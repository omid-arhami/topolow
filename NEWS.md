# topolow 0.3.2

*  Initial release to CRAN.
*  Introduces the Topolow algorithm, a physics-inspired method for antigenic cartography.
*  Provides robust mapping and complete positioning of all antigens, even with highly sparse datasets (>95% missing values).
*  Implements automatic, likelihood-based estimation to determine the optimal dimensionality of the antigenic map.
*  Includes functionality to calculate "antigenic velocity" vectors to quantify the rate and direction of antigenic drift.
*  Features tools for handling and processing cross-reactivity and binding affinity assay data, including those with thresholded values.
*  Demonstrates improved prediction accuracy and run-to-run stability compared to traditional MDS methods.
