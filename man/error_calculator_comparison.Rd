\title{Calculate comprehensive error metrics between predicted and true distances}
\usage{
error_calculator_comparison(p_dist_mat, truth_matrix, input_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{p_dist_mat}{Matrix of predicted distances}

\item{truth_matrix}{Matrix of true distances}

\item{input_matrix}{Matrix of input distances (may contain NAs and is used to find the NAs' pattern)}
}
\value{
List containing:
\item{report_df}{Data frame with error metrics per point}
\item{coverage}{Numeric coverage statistic}
}
\description{
Computes various error metrics including in-sample and out-of-sample errors,
and coverage statistics for model evaluation.
}
\details{
Input requirements and constraints:
\itemize{
\item Matrices must have matching dimensions
\item Row and column names must be consistent between matrices
\item NAs are allowed and handled appropriately
\item Threshold indicators (< or >) in input matrix are processed correctly
}
}
