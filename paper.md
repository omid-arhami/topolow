# Summary

Antigenic cartography is a crucial tool for visualizing and analyzing antigenic relationships between viruses. Here we present `topolow`, an R package implementing a novel physics-inspired algorithm for antigenic mapping. The algorithm uses spring forces and repulsive interactions to optimize point configurations in high-dimensional spaces while handling missing and thresholded measurements.
