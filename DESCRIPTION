Description: An implementation of the TopoLow algorithm, a novel, physics-inspired method for 
    antigenic cartography. TopoLow addresses significant challenges in mapping antigenic relationships, 
    especially from sparse and noisy experimental data. The package transforms cross-reactivity and 
    binding affinity measurements into accurate spatial representations in a phenotype space.
    Key features include:
    * Robust Mapping from Sparse Data: Effectively creates complete and consistent maps even with high 
    proportions of missing data (e.g., >95%).
    * Physics-Inspired Optimization: Models antigens as particles connected by springs (for measured 
    interactions) and subject to repulsive forces (for missing interactions), reducing the need for 
    complex gradient computations.
    * Automatic Dimensionality Detection: Employs a likelihood-based approach to determine the optimal 
    number of dimensions for the antigenic map, avoiding distortions common in methods with fixed low dimensions.
    * Noise and Bias Reduction: Naturally mitigates experimental noise and bias through its network-based, 
    error-dampening mechanism.
    * Antigenic Velocity Calculation: Introduces and quantifies "antigenic velocity," a vector that describes 
    the rate and direction of antigenic drift for each pathogen isolate. This can help identify cluster 
    transitions and potential lineage replacements.
    * Broad Applicability: Analyzes data from various pathogens, including influenza, HIV, and Dengue viruses. 
    It can be applied to any continuous and relational phenotype under directional selection pressure.
